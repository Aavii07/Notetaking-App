This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Notetaking-App

This is my very own notetaking app created from scratch using React Native cli with Typescript and utilizing SQLite to store and manage all the notes.

Note that this app is only targeted and tested for android devices.

To run this application, simply run pnpm install followed by pnpm start in the project directory.

Here are some sample images that show generally how the app works:

When viewing notes, you can use pinch to zoom:

Works on devices of different proportions as well:

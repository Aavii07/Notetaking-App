This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Notetaking-App

This is my very own notetaking app created from scratch using React Native cli with Typescript and utilizing SQLite to store and manage all the notes.

Note that this app is only targeted and tested for android devices.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Notetaking-App

This is my very own notetaking app created from scratch using React Native cli with Typescript and utilizing SQLite to store and manage all the notes.

Note that this app is only targeted and tested for android devices.

To run this application, simply run pnpm install followed by pnpm start in the project directory.

Below is a sample video that demonstrates this app's functionality:

Note that the gesture I am doing in the emulator later in the video simulates pinch-to-zoom.

This app was designed to work on devices of different sizes and proportions as well:
